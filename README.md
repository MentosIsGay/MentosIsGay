- 👋 Hi, I’m @MentosIsGay
- 👀 I code in python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on python projects.
I might make something in python for you if you ask nicely. I do not have a discord but I have a guilded! My name is MentosIsGay.

I am lookng to do a project with anyone as long as it includes javascript or python. 



I also like reading and gaming. I play on PC.



Motivation for people
1. It's okay to take breaks while coding, dont over work it!
2. A fail is proof you are trying.
3. Keep on going if it makes you happy
4. You're awesome!!






I love you gabby! <3
